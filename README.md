# Extism-powered frontend, with Go server and Extism plugin compiled with Go

This repo is for my own practice using Golang and client-side JS with Extism.

## Structure

/build: this is where bundle(s?) are generated by esbuild and referred to by src/index.html

/src: the raw files. Index.js is compiled to bundle.js, which is used by index.js

/server: a Go server that serves the required files

/plugin: the wasm plugin we compile. build command: `tinygo build -o plugin.wasm -target wasip1 -buildmode=c-shared main.go`
